# jimnazeum

jimnazeum is an RPG where you can train in the real world to level up in the virtual

Train your virtual persona by hitting the gym in the real world and consistenly logging your workouts and prgoress. Virtual gym personas will level up, unlock new cosmetics, and rule over the virtual world of jimnazeum.

## Details

Some game features we want to implement are:

- Track and time workouts
- Learn new lifts and stretches
- Gain XP by being consistent
- Use your XP to unlock cosmetics and upgrade your characters RPG-like stacks in order to take on the world of jimnazeum

We have not thought of what the gamified feature of jimnazeum will be yet. PVP battles is an option. So is creating some kind of world building sim (e.g, create your own perfect gym and let other users visit it.) Real world workouts could affect how you perform in the virtual world or what type of cosmetics you can unlock.
  
### Workout Features

- Timers (standard and HIIT)
- Habit tracking heatmap
- Database of workouts with how to's and animations
- Character creation and customization opportunities when leveling up
- Leveling up is done by being consistent and improving at the real world gym
- The game should be built for iOS and Android
